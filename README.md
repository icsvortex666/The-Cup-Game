# [*The Cup Game*](http://icsvortex666.github.io/The-Cup-Game/)

Game coded by [*Amit Feldman*](https://www.twitter.com/amityofbodom) on August 30th, 2016.

## Game Instructions

Find the ball in the cup.
Each time the ball has been found, the player is awarded with 10 points. The player can add an extra cup if he chooses to do so (as a matter of adding an extra layer of difficulty) and will be awarded 15 points, **once per additional cup**. If the player misses the right cup, all the awarded points will be removed.

```
- Press the Start button to begin the game.
- Press the Shuffle button to randomly shuffle the ball and cups.
- Click the Cup you would like to check.
- Click [YES] when prompted, to add a new Cup into the game board.
- Press Shuffle to continue playing.
```

## Technologies used

- **jQuery**: For faster MVP development.
- **jQuery UI**: For cups animation. I decided to go with this library, because I couldn't make the cups shuffle randomly.
- **Google Fonts**.
